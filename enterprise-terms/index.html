  </h1>


<div class="post-text " id="">
<ol type="a">
<li>Subject to this Agreement, Customer may use the Scantrust Platform for its own business purposes during each Subscription Term (<b>“Permitted Use”</b>). The <b>“Platform”</b> means Scantrust’s proprietary multi-portal cloud-based service, which enables Customer to generate, and utilize Identifiers on its products, to upload product and other Customer information, as identified in the relevant Order. This includes the right to use the Platform and Documentation (<b>“Documentation”</b> means the standard manuals and technical information provided to Customer by Scantrust either in print or electronic form, including access and use instructions for the Platform) as part of Customer’s Permitted Use.</li>
<li>
<b>Users.</b> Customer “Admin” (one or more individuals authorized by Customer) may permit a certain number of users (as set forth in the Order, or if none set forth up to a maximum of 10) to use the Platform on its behalf (“Users”). Users may include (i) employees, advisors and contractors of Customer and its Affiliates and (ii) others if permitted in this Agreement, the Documentation or an Order. Customer is responsible for provisioning and managing its User accounts, for its Users’ actions through the Platform and for their compliance with this Agreement. Customer will ensure that Users keep their login credentials confidential and will promptly notify Provider upon learning of any compromise of User accounts or credentials.</li>
<li>
<b>Use of Customer Data.</b> Subject to this Agreement, Scantrust will access and use Customer Data solely to provide and maintain the Platform, Professional Services and SLA activities under this Agreement.

<b>Security.</b> Scantrust will implement and maintain appropriate administrative, physical, technical and organizational measures including disaster recovery procedures, designed to prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure of Customer Data.  Scantrust will maintain compliance audit documentation and will make available a copy to Customer upon prior written request for Customer’s use solely for its internal compliance requirements and any governmental or regulatory authority inspections.</li>
<li>
<b>DPA.</b> The parties will adhere to the DPA.</li>
<li>
<b>Usage Data.</b> Scantrust may collect Usage Data and use it to operate, improve and support the Platform and for other lawful business purposes, including benchmarking and reports.

<li>
<b>SLA.</b> The Platform is hosted on Amazon Web Services in Ireland (“AWS”).  Scantrust will use reasonable commercial efforts to meet up-time availability metrics set forth in the SLA, subject to the availability of AWS. Scantrust will provide support via the Platform and email (support@scantrust.com) as set forth in the SLA.</li>
