<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you protect your customers, brand, and products from counterfeiting? What is important for such solutions that provide that protection? Four words: security, usability, scalability, and utility. There are many physical and digital anti-counterfeiting technologies available, but which is the right one for your company? To understand some of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the pros and cons of different types of anti-counterfeiting technology this article discusses:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">How secure QR codes work as an anti-counterfeiting technology</span></li>

<div class="post-text " id="">
<p><strong>How secure QR codes work as an anti-counterfeiting technology</strong></p>
<p>Secure QR codes are unlike standard QR codes because they include a copy detection feature that is the basis for their usefulness as anti-counterfeiting tools. Standard QR codes are designed to be very easy to print from a source digital file. This, in turn, makes them easy to replicate as a data carrier that is very useful for marketing, logistics, and any application where a user needs quick access to online information. Secure QR codes take advantage of those properties and add a copy detection layer to get the best of both worlds. Here are a few characteristics of secure QR codes:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instant authentication result using a smartphone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Familiarity and ease of use for consumers: QR code usage is universal.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No need for special phone apps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can be used anywhere existing marketing and supply chain tools are using QR codes or similar tools</span></li>
</ul>

    Covert vs. Overt Technologies
  </h2>


<div class="post-text " id="">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overt anti-counterfeiting is typified by a feature than anyone can observe without special tools, devices, or training. An overt anti-counterfeiting tool is difficult to reproduce and may include physical security features such as a tamper-proof seal. Some examples of overt anti-counterfeiting are holographic labels, color-shifting inks, and micro texts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covert anti-counterfeiting solutions contrast with overt anti-counterfeiting in that they are not immediately discernible or observable. They are only visible with specialized tools or techniques. Covert anti-counterfeiting tools are hidden to avoid obvious identification: this is part of the strategy. Some examples of covert anti-counterfeiting are special inks, UV ink that only shines under ultraviolet light, magnetic inks, DNA taggants, and patterns of dots that are distributed randomly across a graphical design. Those are known as sparse patterns. You will also see some copy detection patterns included in the covert anti-counterfeiting category. </span></p>
</div>

    ">
    Physical vs. Digital
  </h1>


<div class="post-text " id="">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second distribution or differentiation that I would like to make is to compare two approaches for physical and digital anti-counterfeiting tools. The physical tools, the visual that can actually be also haptic help with inspection of the product. So as an example, you can look at your euro bank note or dollar or whatever is your currency and there is usually several types of these physical features that are overt, and you can compare the hologram, you can compare the embossed text, you can compare the watermarks, you can compare other special physical features of the currency of the banknote and assess the authenticity. On the other hand, the digital anti-counterfeiting tools, they require a dedicated digital or electronic device that is used to confirm the authenticity of the product. So for example, it can be the RFID readers, it can be special inks.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:12:29.780] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was saying, that is the UV light. So you can have a special UV torch that you can shine on the product and some special text printed with the UV ink will actually pop up. This can also be magnetic, it can be DNA markers, and for these assessments, it can be anything from the reader, which is for example in the ATM and the cash machine that actually authenticates the credit card or through special dedicated devices, for example, the UV torch or to special mobile application that the consumers, for example, can download and can authenticate.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:13:13.250] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, every single of this category or differentiation bears certain positive aspects and certain negative aspects. So if we would look a little closer at the pros and cons of the physical authentication tools, definitely these are tools that we all know that we are very familiar. Each of us holds such a tool if we just compare the banknote several times a week, if not every day. So we are pretty familiar with it, and there is a good reason why these tools are still available. But there is also a good reason why these tools are not the only tools for the authentication of bank notes.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:14:07.130] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undeniably. The pros of the physical authentication tool is its price. It&#8217;s not requiring any special tool and quite positive it&#8217;s also its easy usage. Meaning if we would know how the Hologram looks like, it would be relatively easy to actually assess the authenticity.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:14:40.770] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are some significant negative aspects of these solutions, and that is the not reliability in providing the binary result. You will not be able to say okay, this is real or fake. There will be always certain knowledge gap that is actually need to be crossed to successfully authenticate. The second core of the physical tools is that the duplicates don&#8217;t need to be really perfect. If we would be honest to ourselves, how many of us would know precisely how the Hologram on the Euro banknote looks like, how the authentic Hologram looks like, very little people from the general public would be actually able to tell okay, this is the original Hologram, it should shine in a certain way, it should be shifting the colors and light in certain way.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:15:48.890] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, this gap is the biggest obstacle for the whole tool to be really functional. And that way if we don&#8217;t know how the original Hologram should look like, that means also the duplicates don&#8217;t need to be perfect. It&#8217;s usually enough to trigger consumer if the color is shifting in a certain way. Another negative aspect of the physical tools is that there is no possibility to add additional functionality to these tools. Nobody really knows how many consumers are looking at the Hologram every day.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:16:28.610] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this is really passive tool that it&#8217;s not bringing any business intelligence to the brand owner or to the government.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:16:39.870] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the last negative that I have listed here is actually kind of repeating the high degree of education that is needed because for experts who is trained to authenticate the Holograms, it is relatively easy. See on the first side, okay, this is suspected counterfeit, or this is authentic product. For the general public, even with several versions of a Hologram, for certain banknotes, it is close to impossible to actually know all the details, how all the Holograms should look like. If we would look at digital tools. For digital tool, there is a dedicated digital electronic device used to confirm the authenticity of the anti-counterfeiting tool. As an example, we can imagine the ATM authenticating our credit card.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:17:42.550] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an authentication that actually happens during the moment when we insert the credit card into the ATM.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:17:53.930] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The important positive aspects of the digital tool is really high security and reliability of the solution that actually really provides binary result. Okay, this is fake product or real product. So these solutions really can reliably provide secure answer to the user in many cases. In the case of ATM, this answer is basically underlying basis for the whole transaction to be happening with the credit card. Of course digital tools not only for the credit cards can be used also with the smartphones, apps can be used with dedicated devices, and these digital solutions always provide higher security and reliability than the physical tools. Additional functionality or additional positive aspect of digital tool especially in the cases of a smartphone that is publicly available for the consumers is that this can enable traceability of the product and traceability of the supply chain and can provide additional functionality for the brand owners and additional edit value for the brand.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:19:22.170] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the negative side of the tools definitely, the tool itself is also the con. So you need to purchase or at least download a necessary application, and you need to perform certain necessary steps to authenticate a product, and this is usually perceived also as a negative aspect of it.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:19:52.230] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second negative is you may have some solutions that are very hard to use, so there needs to be certain level of knowledge, and especially in the cases like UV lights or other DNA markers that require special devices, there might be also the barrier for the education. And usually, these solutions are also a little bit more costly and scalability might be an issue. So if we would basically look at the two segmentation between overt and covert and the physical and digital authentication. When you are using or deciding about the technology, it is important to consider several factors, but to kind of highlight the main three is definitely security and robustness is important to serve the function against the counterfeiting. Usability for users and consumers is another group that is very important because if you have something secure but cannot be used by anyone what would be the point of it? And the last objective to achieve that I would like to point out is the business data.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:21:27.510] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the solution that you would be looking at and would be considering should be valuable for your business, not only for the protection but also should allow you the whole knowledge and should allow you to understand better what is actually happening in the market. If we would play several technologies that are widely available or known to the public and would place them in certain locations. Basically, to give you an example of something very secure and not really usable, it&#8217;s a DNA, it&#8217;s a technology that is decades old, and it&#8217;s very secure, basically close to impossible to replicate but also it has no usage for the consumer in the field. Consumer cannot really assess the authenticity because they don&#8217;t have dedicated devices that are actually only produced for defining and specifying and finding the DNA in the material or on the packaging. Another example or another extreme or something that is very usable for the consumer but security and robustness is rather questionable would be holograms.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:22:51.700] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So holograms are coming from a technology that is more than 30 years old and basically had been used in the still used on the currency today. But for many years he&#8217;s been the only possible way for anti-counterfeiting and basically how to mark and how to demonstrate that the product is secure and secured. Holograms were used for this purpose. Today if you go on certain online platforms you are able to order authentication holograms with any logo, any design that you want. You can have it delivered in several days.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:23:40.950] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also because it&#8217;s not connected usually to anything, just the pure hologram, for example, the one on the banking code, it provides very little business data and business intelligence. And the third extreme of a solution that provides only business intelligence but it&#8217;s not really secure or robust when you have a counterfeit product in your hand or your consumers cannot use it in the field when they are making the buying decision. For example online brand protection. These anticounterfeiting means or solutions are actually searching through the online environment and trying to find a fake listing. This is very important practice and very important exercise but also cannot restrict all the channels for the counterfeit products in the field because obviously for obvious reasons, it doesn&#8217;t capture something like the shops in the streets because they don&#8217;t have any online presence.</span></p>
<h5><b>[00:24:44.910] &#8211; Peter</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we would look at solutions that are more combined and are combining multiple objectives, we definitely could look at RFID that is very secure and robust and provides business data. For example, the credit card authentications because the RFID in the credit cards is just effectively NFC but doesn&#8217;t work with the smartphone authentication. It provides less of the consumer usability or consumer benefits. The NFC is definitely a solution or subgroup of RFID solutions that provide the security, provide the business data, and provide also the usability for consumers. If we would look at the UV inc, provide certain usability for the consumers, they also are relatively secure and robust, but because for example they only work with the UV torch, they don&#8217;t really provide too much of business data.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you look at standard QR codes, especially those that are serialized, they do provide a good usability for consumers, and they also provide business data, but they are not very robust against the counterfeiting, and they are relatively low-security level. The combination is NFC. We also see here the secure QR codes. Secure QR codes are kind of QR code with a superpower. And a secure QR code really provide high-security level and robustness against counterfeiting. It provides or combines the great usability of QR code to any consumer with a smartphone can use them and also provide a lot of business data because through QR codes, especially if they are serialized.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can provide a lot of product information, additional values but also get back a lot of data points from the consumers and from the market.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a secure QR code? To go more in-depth into understanding what secure QR code really means and why it&#8217;s better than a normal QR code is the concept of copy detection pattern. In Scantrust, we have a secure graphic which is a section with a copy detection pattern that is inserted into QR code. This QR code can be unique for every product or can be unique for SKU level and works as a normal QR code. The combination of these two is a carrier of identity.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The QR code plus secure graphic equals secured QR code. This QR code really combines the best of the two worlds. It provides the ease of use of a normal QR code, but thanks to the secure graphic, it also can work and can serve for authentication.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the brand owners are often using this to engage with the consumers in their localized conditions. So they can have language adjustments, they can have various adjustments for various products across different regions, but they can also provide incentivization for authentication. So the consumer can not only reach the product information and authenticity, but they can also exchange some other information with the brand owners. So to go through the four benefits that are listed at the beginning security, usability, scalability, and utility. If we would look at the security aspects of secure QR codes, definitely the solution can provide instant binary authentication results so you, your consumer, didn&#8217;t know whether they hold authentic product or suspected counterfeit product.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And because the copy detection pattern is very stable technology, it also provides a high security that can be achieved through the existing production procedures. On the usability side, the secure QR codes are definitely easy to use for consumers. You can see especially after the pandemic of the COVID19, QR codes are today everywhere. It&#8217;s definitely a growing trend of the QR code usage. Before it was domain of China, QR codes were everywhere.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today it&#8217;s the domain of the whole world. Companies started to use the QR code in much more meaningful way before 2019. And today also the majority of the smartphones they natively recognize and scan QR codes. So usually you don&#8217;t need to even download any additional application like it was five, seven years ago. On the scalability side, because secure QR codes is actually printed technology, it is a solution that is relatively easy to deploy at scale.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s compatible with the majority of the conventional printing technologies, which makes it cost-effective compared to other technologies, for example to NFC and you also don&#8217;t need to run the serialization. So for several product trenches, it makes sense to have a non-serialized QR codes that are secured and can run the authentication. So, unless you really need a granularity of a unit-level serialization secure QR codes provide not only serialization but they can also provide a non-serialized authentication of products. In the fourth value, the utility is that the QR codes can seamlessly connect the existing marketing and supply chain tools. You can connect the QR codes to your existing e-commerce platform, you can connect to your ERP system, you can connect them to any existing solution that we have currently within your company.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secure QR codes can also provide additional incentives, long lines of product information or added digital value for final users, which also increases the perceived value of your products. And last but not least, because you enable your final customers to actually interact with the product, you are effectively crowdsourcing the anti-counterfeiting and supply chain traceability data. And you are also significantly growing the connection and engagement with your final consumer. Within Scantrust platform we have several dashboards, and basically because every single scan of a QR code is a data point, or actually carries several data points, we are trying to make from these data points business intelligence. So we closely work with our customers to actually identify the suspicious activities on the QR codes on the QR code alerts. But we are also able to provide the user demographics and user engagement, what actually happens after the authentication, and who are the consumers who actually interact with the products of yours.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, this is all GDPR compliant and complies with all the global regulation depending on where the project is actually running. If we would look on several use cases at the end, how our customers are actually utilizing the solution.</span></p>
